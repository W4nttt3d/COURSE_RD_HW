## Game “RimWorld”

## Game description.

This is a survival strategy game in which the player controls NPCs. The game is at an early stage of development and contains basic movement and resource gathering features.

## Current features.

- NPCS: There are 4 NPCs in the game that can collect resources (wood, stones, metal) and move them to specific areas of the map.
- Movement on the map**: NPCs can move around the map, searching for resources and moving them to specific locations.
- Resource Gathering System: NPCs can collect resources from tiles and move them to other tiles. (Not complete and bad)

## Known Bugs.

- NPCs getting stuck in trees**: NPCs sometimes get stuck in tiles with trees while moving.
- Diagonal movement issues**: NPCs do not build a path correctly when moving diagonally.
- Resources do not appear on the save tile**: Resources do not always appear on the tiles where they are supposed to be stored after being moved.

## Future plans.

1. Bug fixes:
   - Improve the logic of NPC movement to avoid getting stuck in objects.
   - Improve diagonal movement algorithms.
   - Fix the problem with saving resources on the corresponding tiles.

2. Functionality enhancements:
   - Implementation of a task priority system for NPCs.
   - Adding a construction system (erecting buildings on the map).
   - Development of livestock and crop production to expand the gameplay.
   - Implementation of a medical system for NPCs.
   - Development of a mood system for NPCs that will affect their efficiency and behavior.
   - Porting the game to mobile devices.
